# API Reference (ðŸš§ Under development)

Along side the `envio` CLI, `envio` also provides a programmatic API for users to interact with all the features of `envio` in their own applications. The API is written in Rust and is available as a crate on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/envio). The API is designed to be easy to use and provides a simple interface for users to interact with `envio` in their own applications.

:::note

Since the project is still in its early stages, the API is subject to change. Therefore until the API is stable, you can find examples of how to use the API at the project's GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/envio-cli/envio/tree/main/examples)
