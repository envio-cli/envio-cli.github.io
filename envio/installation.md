# Installation

This section will guide you through the installation process of `envio` on your machine.

:::warning

After installing `envio`, take a look at the [GPG Encryption](./encryption-methods.md#gpg-encryption) section to install the necessary dependencies for GPG encryption.

Failure to do so will result in `envio` crashing. In a future release, we plan to make the installation of these dependencies optional. But for now, it is **mandatory** to install them.
