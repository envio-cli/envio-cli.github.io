# Intro

:::warning

Before reading this section make sure you understand what `profiles` (See [profiles](../profiles.md)) are in `envio`.

:::

Each command in `envio` has its own set of flags that can be used to modify their behavior. These flags have a short form and a long form, and users can choose to use either of them. For instance, the `--file-to-import-envs-from` flag can be written as `-f`. Both forms of the flag are equivalent and can be used interchangeably. This guide provides examples for each flag with both variants, to make it easy for users to remember and use them.
