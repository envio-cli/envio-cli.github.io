# Unload a Profile

On `Windows`, to unload a profile from the current session, run the command:
```bash
$ envio unload <profile_name>
```

On `Unix-based` operating systems, to unload a profile from the current session, run the `envio unload` command without any arguments:
```bash
$ envio unload
```

This will remove the environment variables from the current session and make them unavailable for use.
