# Delete a Profile
If you wish to delete your profile, then run the following command without any flags:
```bash
$ envio remove <profile_name>
```

For example, to delete the `myprofile` profile, you would run the command:
```bash
$ envio remove myprofile
```

This will remove the profile from your setup and delete all the environment variables associated with it.
