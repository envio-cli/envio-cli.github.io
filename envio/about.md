# About

`envio` is a open source CLI tool that helps make managing environment variables a breeze. With envio, users can create encrypted profiles that contain a collection of environment variables associated with a specific project or use case. envio ensures security and simplifies the development process by allowing users to easily switch between profiles as needed and load them in their current terminal session for immediate use.

Some of the key features of envio include:

- **Encrypted profiles** through passphrase or GPG encryption. See [encryption types](./encryption-methods) for more information.
- **Load** profiles into your terminal sessions
- **Persistent** environment variables that are available in future sessions
- **Run** programs with your profiles
- **Importing** profiles from a file
- **Downloading** profiles and then importing them
- **Exporting** profiles to a file such as a `.env` file

The following platforms are currently supported:
- **Windows**
- **MacOS**
- **Linux**
