# About

`envio` is a open source CLI tool that helps make managing environment variables a breeze. With envio, users can create encrypted profiles that contain a collection of environment variables associated with a specific project or use case. envio ensures security and simplifies the development process by allowing users to easily switch between profiles as needed and load them in their current terminal session for immediate use.

Some of the key features of envio include:

- **Encrypted** profiles through `passphrase` or `GPG` encryption. See [encryption types](./encryption-methods)
- **Load** profiles into your `terminal sessions`
- **Persistent** environment variables that are available in `future sessions`
- **Run** programs with your profiles
- **Importing** profiles stored on the internet into your local installation
- **Exporting** profiles to a file

The following platforms are currently supported:
- **Windows**
- **MacOS**
- **Linux**
