# Quick Start Guide


Visit the [installation](./installation) page to learn how to install envio on your system.

## Creating a Profile

Before you can start using envio, you need to create a profile. A profile is a collection of environment variables that you want to manage together.

To create a profile, run the following command:

```bash
$ envio create <profile_name>
```

Replace `<profile_name>` with the name you want to give to your profile. For example:
```bash
$ envio create myprofile
```

By default, `envio` uses passphrase encryption to protect your profile. After running the above command, envio will prompt you to enter a passphrase to encrypt your profile. Make sure to remember the passphrase as it will be required to decrypt your profile later.

If you want to use `GPG` encryption instead of passphrase encryption, use the following command:

```bash
$ envio create <profile_name> -g <gpg_key_fingerprint>
```

Replace `<gpg_key_fingerprint>` with the fingerprint of the GPG key you want to use. Or you can replace `<gpg_key_fingerprint>` with select, this will prompt you with a list of all the public GPG keys available on your system, and you can select the one you want to use.

## Adding Environment Variables to a Profile

Once you have created a profile, you can add environment variables to it using the following command:

```bash
$ envio add <profile_name> -e <key>=<value>
```

Replace `<profile_name>` with the name of the profile you want to add the environment variable to, `<key>` with the name of the environment variable you want to add, and `<value>` with the value you want to assign to the environment variable.

For example:

```bash
$ envio add myprofile -e DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost/mydb
```

You can also add multiple environment variables at once:

```bash
$ envio add myprofile -e 'DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost/mydb MY_VERY_SECRETIVE_KEY=1234'
```

Make sure you include the environment variables you want to add in between quotes, separated by a space.

If you have environment variables stored in a file, you can import them using the following command:

```bash
$ envio create <profile_name> -f <file_name>
```

Replace `<file_name>` with the name of the file containing the environment variables you want to import.

## Updating Environment Variables in a Profile

To update an existing environment variable, use the following command:

```bash
$ envio update <profile_name> -e <key>=<new_value>
```

Replace `<profile_name>` with the name of the profile you want to update the environment variable in, `<key>` with the name of the environment variable you want to update, and `<new_value>` with the new value you want to assign to the environment variable. 

For example:

```bash
$ envio update myprofile -e DATABASE_URL=postgres://myhost/mydb
```

## Deleting Environment Variables from a Profile

To delete an environment variable from a profile, use the following command:

```bash
$ envio remove <profile_name> -e <key>
```

Replace `<profile_name>` with the name of the profile you want
